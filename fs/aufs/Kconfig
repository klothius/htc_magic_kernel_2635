config AUFS_FS
	tristate "Aufs (Advanced multi layered unification filesystem) support"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs,
	which unifies several directories and provides a merged single
	directory.
	In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and
	re-implemented Unionfs Version 1.x series. Introducing many
	original ideas, approaches and improvements, it becomes totally
	different from Unionfs while keeping the basic features.

	help
	Specifies the maximum number of branches (or member directories)
	in a single aufs. The larger value consumes more system
	resources and has a minor impact to performance.

	Specifies the maximum number of branches (or member directories)
	in a single aufs. The larger value consumes more system

	bool "Use inotify to detect actions on a branch"
	depends on INOTIFY
	help
	If you want to modify files on branches directly, eg. bypassing aufs,
	and want aufs to detect the changes of them fully, then enable this
	option and use 'udba=inotify' mount option.
	It will have a negative impact to the performance.
	See detail in aufs.5.

config AUFS_EXPORT
	bool "NFS-exportable aufs"
	depends on EXPORTFS = y
	help
	If you want to export your mounted aufs via NFS, then enable this
	option. There are several requirements for this configuration.
	See detail in aufs.5.

	Enable this to compile aufs internal debug code.
	It will have a negative impact to the performance.
